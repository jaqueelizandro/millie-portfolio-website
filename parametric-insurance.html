                        <p>
                            Insurance has been around since the 1830’s and started
                            out as a "community pot of money", that would be used
                            for funerals and other disasters. From these humble
                            beginnings, it is now currently worth 76 billion and
                            is projected to grow to 98 billion by 2025 in Australia.
                            This growth is fuelled by post COVID recovery, and the
                            increasing effects of climate change.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            People buy insurance because it provides "peace of mind"
                            and also provides a "sense of security", in a life that
                            is full of change and uncertainty.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We were asked by Firemark to test the desirability and
                            viability of such products, which we know is called
                            Parametric Insurance, and also look at the business
                            goals of reducing customer churn due to unaffordability.

                            From the user's perspective, we needed to understand
                            their behaviours and motivations to buy insurance,
                            pain-points while using insurance products and also
                            thoughts on parametric insurance.

                            an image overhaul.

                            in customer loyalty and retention and everyone, including
                            the business, achieves peace of mind.

                    To begin, we needed to learn more about our client, the Insurance
                    Market and Parametric Insurance around the world in order to better
                    understand the
                    <strong>users</strong>
