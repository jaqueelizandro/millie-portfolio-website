                            Insurance has been around since the 1830’s and started
                            out as a "community pot of money", that would be used
                            for funerals and other disasters. From these humble
                            beginnings, it is now currently worth 76 billion and
                            is projected to grow to 98 billion by 2025 in Australia.
                            This growth is fuelled by post COVID recovery, and the
                            increasing effects of climate change.

                        to help victims of natural disasters get by in the time
                        between the occurrence of a natural disaster, and the time
                        the insurance company takes to pay out the damage costs.

                    From our interviews, we learned that <strong>insurance in Australia
                    has an image problem</strong> and that problem stems from there
                    being a lack of transparency. For something as vital as insurance,
                    more care needs to be taken when dealing with the entire subject
                    matter from start to finish.

                    Based on insights from our

                    It was hard to locate Direct Competitors in Australia. In fact
                    there is only one currently offering

                    . That wasn’t enough for us to get a proper understyanding
                    on what “the best” were doing.

                    So we again expanded our net and went for the top performers
                    both nationally, and internationally. It turned out that all
                    the best are transparent, honest, and their insurance plans
                    are simple and <strong>to-the-point</strong>.

                    The metrics that were used in the rating system included
                    <span class="purple">transparency, value for money, customer
                    service</span> and <span class="purple">claim approvals</span>.
                    Interestingly, these are the same reasons that were brought
                    up in our <i>User Interviews</i>-so there is a common theme
                    here about <span class="purple">“What customers look for in insurance”</span> .

                    Brands such as NRMA and SGIO received <span class="purple">far
                    less approval ratings</span> than best practise such as local
                    insurer Honey and Lemonade from the US. We can see that there
                    is a distinct correlation between the ease of information and
                    transparency and the star rating and user approval.

                    Knowing that best practise is all about providing transparent
                    information, our ideation phase began and we found that our
                    focus was more about how we could visually and descriptively
                    do this using UI and UX copy.
