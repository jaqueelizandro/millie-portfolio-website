                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p>Australian Red Cross Lifeblood is facing a huge problem.
                    Thousands of appointments are being cancelled a week and 43%
                    of first time donors are not coming back. After COVID, less
                    people are donating regularly and more people are cancelling
                    (1 in 5 to be exact) due to feelings of “social hangover” and
                    stress caused by COVID. This is causing a downturn in blood
                    supply and to keep up with demand, Lifeblood needs 140,000
                    more blood donors in 2022 to meet the needs of patients across
                    Australia (an increase of 45 per cent).</p>
                <h3>Business Goal</h3>
                <p>Improve the digital experience to encourage donors to book more often.</p>
                <h3>Conclusions</h3>
                <p>We believe that the Donate Today feature will encourage donors
                    to donate regularly and help Lifeblood meet the demand for
                    blood, by prioritising time and location instead of date alone.</p>
            </div>
            <a href="#solution"><button>Jump to the solution</button></a>
            <div>
                “Lifeblood needs a way to understand and solve their digital
                experience, because they want to encourage donors who already
                have been to donate to continue coming back and not cancelling.”
            </div>
            <img src="images/australia-red-cross/attention-sign.svg" />
            <p>To be able to improve a digital solution, as UX Designers we needed
                to to evaluate and determine where the pain points were in the whole
                process of donating blood, and how we could meet the business goal
                of improving the digital experience to be able to encourage current
                donors to book more often.</p>
            <p>From the user's perspective, we needed to understand:</p>
            <p>- the behaviours and motivations of past and current donors</p>
            <p>- how to motivate them to return</p>
            <p>- identify any friction points in the donation process</p>
            <h2>The Research Phase begins</h2>
            <p>Understanding the impact of the Donation Process on donors through</p>
            <p>Market Research and User Interviews</p>
            <p>We needed to find out WHY donation rates declined during COVID,
                and WHAT motivates people to donate blood. Trhought Market Research,
                we were able to answer a few questions we had, and also prove some
                of our Assumptions about what was happening.</p>
            <h3>5 main reasons why people donate blood</h3>
            <h4>Donor Identity</h4>
            <p>It makes me feel good to know that I helped someone.</p>
            <h4>Knowing someone</h4>
            <p>I know someone who is in need of blood.</p>
            <h4>Reciprocity</h4>
            <p>I donate in case myself or someone I know may need it.</p>
            <h4>Inspiration</h4>
            <p>I want to inspire others to do something good.</p>
            <h4>Fairness & Equality</h4>
            <p>If I am happy to receive blood, I should be happy to donate it.</p>
            <img src="images/australia-red-cross/donation-symbol.svg" />
            <p>
                Through the previous research, we learned that when you donate
                blood you are VOLUNTEERING with TIME(!!!). From that, we decided
                to learn more abotut what was happening with other Volunteer
                Organisations in Australia, to understand more about people's
                behaviours.
            </p>
            <h3>What stopped people from volunteering</h3>
            <h4>Uncertain about COVID</h4>
            <p>“I’m unsure about COVID safety at premises.”</p>
            <h4>COVID Restrictions</h4>
            <p>“I cannot volunteer in person due to the restrictions.”</p>
            <h4>Finance Issues</h4>
            <p>“I cannot lose work time to volunteer.”</p>
            <h4>Family commitments</h4>
            <p>“I cannot fit in around family or caring commitments.”</p>
            <img src="images/australia-red-cross/stop-symbol.svg" />
            <div>But, that wasn’t enough...</div>
            <div>We needed to TALK to people.</div>
            <img src="images/australia-red-cross/bubble-question.svg" />
            <p>
                Much of the research was geared towards verifying our assumptions
                and what opportunities we had. We conducted 20 User Interviews
                with the purpose of answering 4 main questions:
            </p>
            <div>
                <p>Why do people donate blood?</p>
                <p>How the pandemic affected the life of the donors?</p>
                <p>What were the reasons why they stopped donating?</p>
                <p>How people donated blood?</p>
            </div>
            <p>
                The key of those interviews was to understand behaviour,
                motivations, feelings and pain points towards the Blood Donation
                process (from booking to getting in the clinic).
            </p>
            <h3>Our findings</h3>
            <p>
                We discovered that 55% stopped donating during COVID and 8 out
                of 20 didn’t donate for over a year.
            </p>
            <h3>Blood Donation during COVID</h3>
            <img src="images/australia-red-cross/graphic-blood-donation.svg" />
            <h3>Sinthesizing our data</h3>
            <p>
                We synthesised our interview answers on individual sticky notes.
                Organising them based on similarity and behaviours, we were able
                to identify the most common trends and pain points.
            </p>
            <p>
                We rephrased the categories with “I statements” to help us bring
                the Human Element that we were looking for.
            </p>
            <img src="images/australia-red-cross/research-outcome.svg" />
            <div>So, WHO are we targeting?</div>
            <img src="images/australia-red-cross/persona-draw.svg" />
            <div>The birth of our personas</div>
            <p>
                Based on Affinity Mapping results, we identified 3 different
                personas, each with different behaviours and motivations towards
                blood donation, which correlated with our Secondary Research findings.
            </p>
            <img src="images/australia-red-cross/cleo-persona.svg" />
            <div>CLEO</div>
            <p>“COVID didn’t impact my life.”</p>
            <p>“I didn’t change idea about blood donation because I felt safe in the clinic.”</p>
            <p>“I felt like I am personally making a difference.”</p>
            <img src="images/australia-red-cross/max-persona.svg" />
            <div>MAX</div>
            <p>“I can’t fit donations within my schedule”</p>
            <p>“I felt really anxious trhoughout COVID”</p>
            <p>
                “I used to donate but now I feel too emationally exhausted.
                It used to make me feel good.”
            </p>
            <img src="images/australia-red-cross/up-left-arrow.svg" />
            <img src="images/australia-red-cross//gabe-persona.svg" />
            <p>
                “I didn’t donate as regularly during COVID as I didn’t want to
                put my life and my family at risk.”
            </p>
            <p>“I donate because my family or I might be in need in the future.”</p>
            <p>
                We had to understand each of their current problems to be able
                to focus on the one that we are going to solve. We decided that
                the persona that would make the GREATEST IMPACT for the BUSINESS
                was the one that used to donate before COVID and suddenly stopped.
                This is known from research that “It is easier to encourage past
                donors to donate more often”, and also meets the Target Audience
                recognised by the Client.
            </p>
            <h3>User Current Journey Map</h3>
            <img src="images/australia-red-cross/user-current-journey-map.svg" />
            <div>
                Based on our current task analysis and to better understand Max,
                we needed to understand his emotional journey when booking an
                appointment around his schedule.
            </div>
            <p>
                After analysing the data gathered from our research, we were able
                to prove our assumptions about the problem and come to define the
                KEY PROBLEM, which was:
            </p>
            <div>
                "Max needs to schedule blood donation appointments when it is
                convenient for him, because he loses motivation if he has to wait."
            </div>
            <div>Wait a minute... What does CONVENIENCE mean for MAX</div>
            <img src="images/australia-red-cross/down-left-arrow.svg" />
            <div>???</div>
            <p>
                We went back to our Affinity Map and based on the insights we got
                from our user interviews, the answer is that:
            </p>
            <p>"Max wanted to prioritise his schedule and emotional state over donating"</p>
            <p>This helped us further refine what we wanted to solve for on the APP.</p>
            <div>SO...</div>
            <div>
                “How Might We ensure that convenience is at the forefront in the
                scheduling process.”
            </div>
            <h3>It’s time for IDEATION</h3>
            <img src="images/australia-red-cross/ideation-icon.svg" />
            <p>
                Leveraging the HMW statement as a springboard and keeping in mind
                the definition of convenience, we generated 24 different ideas in
                1 round of Crazy 8s.
            </p>
            <img src="images/australia-red-cross/ideation-image1.svg" />
            <img src="images/australia-red-cross/ideation-image2.svg" />
            <img src="images/australia-red-cross/ideation-image3.svg" />
            <img src="images/australia-red-cross/ideation-image4.svg" />
            <img src="images/australia-red-cross/ideation-image5.svg" />
            <img src="images/australia-red-cross/ideation-image6.svg" />
            <img src="images/australia-red-cross/ideation-image7.svg" />
            <img src="images/australia-red-cross/ideation-image8.svg" />
            <p>There were 3 similar ideas:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>An interactive map</li>
                <li>Fast track link</li>
                <li>Sorting clinics by distance and next available time.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                But we needed further ideation based on the ‘Interactive map’ and ‘Sorting
                clinics’, so we decided to refine our ideas in a “Design Studio round”.
            </p>
            <img src="images/australia-red-cross/ideation-outcome-image1.svg" />
            <img src="images/australia-red-cross/ideation-outcome-image2.svg" />
            <p>
                From there, we decided as a team to combine the main features we
                wanted to include in the APP to be able to solve the problem for
                the business, from the users’ perspective.
            </p>
            <div>Hypothesis:</div>
            <div>What are we going to prioritise?</div>
            <img src="images/australia-red-cross/right-arrow.svg" />
            <div>
                “We believe Max will be able to donate blood when it is convenient
                for him, if we provide a way to prioritise time and location during
                the booking process. We will know this is true when Max begins to
                donate blood more regularly.”
            </div>
            <img src="images/australia-red-cross/exclamation-mark.svg" />
            <div>Time and Location for Max</div>
            <div>Bring back Past Donors (business goal)</div>
            <div>
                Max goal’s, which is “Be able to book an appointment when it was
                convenient for him.”
            </div>
            <h3>Which features to include?</h3>
            <p>
                Using an MVP matrix, we prioritised the features that would have
                the highest impact, for the lowest effort (by the business).
            </p>
            <p>By voting, we decided to include those 3 following features:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Show available location on map</li>
                <li>Next available time</li>
                <li>Notification (SMS) with a link to our Donate Today feature</li>
            </ul>
            <img src="images/australia-red-cross/mvp-matrix.svg" />
            <h3>Wireframing our solution</h3>
            <img src="images/australia-red-cross/wireframe-icon.svg" />
            <p>
                We developed a low fidelity wireframe to test the flow of the App
                and the basic structure, which we then tested with four users and
                incorporated feedback.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then we moved into a Mid-Fidelity prototype in which we had basic
                shapes, colours and text, which we also tested with four users and
                incorporated feedback.
            </p>
            <img src="images/australia-red-cross/wireframe-image1.svg" />
            <p>
                Next, we got to High Fidelity Prototype where we developed the
                final product, look and feel of our solution based upon the current
                style guide and including new encouraging copy based upon brand
                identity, which we then tested with four users and made changes
                according to the feedback
            </p>    
            <p>
                Then, finally, we included updates and changes from that testing
                to see what it would look like.
            </p>
            <img src="images/australia-red-cross/wireframe-image2.svg" />
            <h3>The final solution - Our Hi-fi Prototype</h3>
            <img src="images/australia-red-cross/prototype-icon.svg" />
            <div>
                The goal of this process was to reduce the cognitive load of the
                user, increase his engagement and fast forward him into a donation
                chair as soon as possible.

                Our solution streamlines the whole process for our user, reducing
                the amount of clickable screens from 4 to 2. At a glance, this
                screen shows “What appointments are available” and “How far away
                they are”. Once the user clicks into them he can see detailed info
                and go to the next screen to confirm his appointment.

                Through prioritising time and location instead of date alone, we
                believe that the DONATE TODAY feature will encourage past donors to
                donate more regularly and help Lifeblood meet the current demand for blood.

                <li>
                    We believe that we were able to achieve the business goals
                    of improving their digital experience by implementing the
                    Donate Today feature. This will encourage people who used
                    to donate, to book more often;
                </li>
                <li>By Iterations and Usability Testing and implementing feedback,
                    we were able to validate our process.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Having deeper conversations with the users to find out their
                    pain points, needs and especially behaviours is the key, it
                    gives us a “North Star”.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Creating a Team Charter at the beggining helped us move forward
                    without any ambiguity according to roles or expectations;
                </li>
                <li>
                    It was amazing to actually be part of such an amazing team, and
                    being able to create a feature that can make a real difference to society.
