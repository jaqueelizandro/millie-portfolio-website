                            Australian Red Cross Lifeblood is facing a huge problem.
                            Thousands of appointments are being cancelled a week and 43%
                            of first time donors are not coming back.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After COVID, lesspeople are donating regularly and more people
                            are cancelling (1 in 5 to be exact) due to feelings of “social
                            hangover” and stress caused by COVID.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This is causing a downturn in blood supply and to keep up with
                            demand, Lifeblood needs 140,000 more blood donors in 2022 to meet
                            the needs of patients across Australia (an increase of 45 per cent).

                            to donate regularly and help Lifeblood meet the demand for
                            blood, by prioritising time and location instead of date alone.

                    Our solution streamlines the whole process for our user, reducing
                    the amount of clickable screens from 4 to 2. At a glance, this
                    screen shows “What appointments are available” and “How far away
                    they are”. Once the user clicks into them he can see detailed info
                    and go to the next screen to confirm his appointment.

                                Donate Today feature. This will encourage people who used
