## Project Description
The projec was conduct based on:
- Figma file: [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/jymFtfQsG6BAMvY8b97YiV/Millie---Portfolio?node-id=307%3A22);
- Interactions/chats through the Figma tool to alert to some changes;
- Zoom meetings to align expectations and comunicate blockers;

You just have to create a group, add the members and share the link with your friends to start splitting your expenses and keep track of who owes who. -->
