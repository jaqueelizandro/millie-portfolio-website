## Introduction
This project is a collaboration work with a recent graduate UX Designer @MilliePoli.

<!-- It was an excellent opportunity to spend more time in the back end, building the Split logic. I also made a unit test and used the TDD approach to help me find a way to solve the problem. -->

<!-- ## Project Description
If you (like many other people) are tired of making sign-in / sign-up for every site they want to use, this is the proper application for you. You just have to create a group, add the members and share the link with your friends to start splitting your expenses and keep track of who owes who. -->

<!-- ## Usage
* Name a group
* Add some inicial members
* Share the link with the **universally unique identifier** with the members
* Add the expenses you like to share
* And settle up with your friends -->
